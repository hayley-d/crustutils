**crustutils** = core + Rust = **crust** + utils. 
</br>
</br>
This project is a Rust library reimplementing essential Unix coreutils.</br>
Why stick with old GNU tools when you can have:  
- **fearless concurrency**
- **memory safety**
- **zero-cost abstractions**  
- **a cute crab mascot**

### **How Itâ€™s Built**

Instead of a collection of separate binaries, `crustutils` is a **single Rust crate**  
that exposes all utilities under one namespace.

You can:
-  Import it as a library (`use crustutils::ls;`) and call utils from other Rust projects.
-  Use the CLI if you want direct terminal commands. 

Want a system toolbox fully written in Rust? This is it.

### **Coreutils to Implement**

| Utility  | Description                    | Status         |
|----------|--------------------------------|----------------|
| `ls`     | List directory contents        | ðŸš§ In progress |
| `cat`    | Concatenate + print files      | ðŸ•‘ Planned     |
| `rm`     | Remove files/directories       | ðŸ•‘ Planned     |
| `touch`  | Create/update files            | ðŸ•‘ Planned     |
| `mkdir`  | Make directories               | ðŸ•‘ Planned     |
| `cp`     | Copy files/directories         | ðŸ•‘ Planned     |
| `mv`     | Move/rename files              | ðŸ•‘ Planned     |
| `echo`   | Print arguments to stdout      | ðŸ•‘ Planned     |

### Why Am I Doing This?
Because:
- Rust.
- Learning system-level programming is cool.
- Everything needs a rust rewrite.
- Ferris looks cooler than a penguin.
